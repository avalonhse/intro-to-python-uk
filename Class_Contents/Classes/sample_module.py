"""This is a sample module.
It defines three functions average(), average_evens(), and average_odds().
The point is to show how we can put Python code in a .py file to be re-used
in some other place.
We should never forget to document the code as well, both on the module
level (i.e., this docstring) but also in every function it defines.
When imported, Python modules are executed top to bottom before the flow of
execution returns to wherever they were imported into.
An important convention is to prefix variables and functions that are not to
be used outside the module with a single underscore "_". This way, we can
design the code within a module in a modular fashion and only "export" what we
want.
Here, all three functions internally forward parts of their computations
to the utility functions _round_all() and _scaled_average() that contain all
the logic common to the three functions.
While this example is stylized, it shows how Python modules are often
designed.
