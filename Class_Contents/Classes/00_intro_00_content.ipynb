    "### Why data science?\n",
    "\n",
    "The term **[data science <img height=\"12\" style=\"display: inline-block\" src=\"static/link_to_wiki.png\">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science)** is rather vague and does *not* refer to an academic discipline. Instead, the term was popularized by the tech industry, who also coined non-meaningful job titles such as \"[rockstar](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-engineers-called-rockstars-and-ninjas)\" or \"[ninja developers](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-engineers-called-rockstars-and-ninjas).\" Most *serious* definitions describe the field as being **multi-disciplinary** *integrating* scientific methods, algorithms, and systems thinking to extract knowledge from structured and unstructured data, *and* also emphasize the importance of **[domain knowledge <img height=\"12\" style=\"display: inline-block\" src=\"static/link_to_wiki.png\">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_knowledge)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, this integration aspect feeds back into the academic world. The [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/), for example, created the new [Stephen A. Schwarzman College of Computing](http://computing.mit.edu) for [artificial intelligence <img height=\"12\" style=\"display: inline-block\" src=\"static/link_to_wiki.png\">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) with a 1 billion dollar initial investment where students undergo a \"bilingual\" curriculum with half the classes in quantitative and method-centric fields - like the ones mentioned above - and the other half in domains such as biology, business, chemistry, politics, (art) history, or linguistics (cf., the [official Q&As](http://computing.mit.edu/faq/) or this [NYT article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/technology/mit-college-artificial-intelligence.html)). Their strategists see a future where programming skills are just as naturally embedded into students' curricula as are nowadays subjects like calculus, statistics, or academic writing. Then, programming literacy is not just another \"nice to have\" skill but a prerequisite, or an enabler, to understanding more advanced topics in the actual domains studied. Top-notch researchers who use programming in their day-to-day lives could then teach students more efficiently in their \"language.\""

    "- [Guido van Rossum <img height=\"12\" style=\"display: inline-block\" src=\"static/link_to_wiki.png\">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) (Python’s **[Benevolent Dictator for Life <img height=\"12\" style=\"display: inline-block\" src=\"static/link_to_wiki.png\">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life)**) was bored during a week around Christmas 1989 and started Python as a hobby project \"that would keep \\[him\\] occupied\" for some days\n",
    "- the idea was to create a **general-purpose** scripting **language** that would allow fast *prototyping* and would *run on every operating system*\n",
    "- Python grew through the 90s as van Rossum promoted it via his \"Computer Programming for Everybody\" initiative that had the *goal to encourage a basic level of coding literacy* as an equal knowledge alongside English literacy and math skills\n",
    "- to become more independent from its creator, the next major version **Python 2** - released in 2000 and still in heavy use as of today - was **open-source** from the get-go which attracted a *large and global community of programmers* that *contributed* their expertise and best practices in their free time to make Python even better\n",
    "- **Python 3** resulted from a significant overhaul of the language in 2008 taking into account the *learnings from almost two decades*, streamlining the language, and getting ready for the age of **big data**\n",
    "- the language is named after the sketch comedy group [Monty Python <img height=\"12\" style=\"display: inline-block\" src=\"static/link_to_wiki.png\">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a **general-purpose** programming **language** that allows for *fast development*, is *easy to read*, **open-source**, long-established, unifies the knowledge of *hundreds of thousands of experts* around the world, runs on basically every machine, and can handle the complexities of applications involving **big data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Isn't C a lot faster?\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is true that a language like C is a lot faster than Python when it comes to *pure* **computation time**, this does not matter in many cases as the *significantly shorter* **development cycles** are the more significant cost factor in a rapidly changing world."

    "To *execute*, or \"*run*,\" a code cell, hold the \"Control\" key and press \"Enter.\" Note that you do *not* go to the subsequent cell. Alternatively, you can hold the \"Shift\" key and press \"Enter,\" which executes the cell *and* places your focus on the subsequent cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, a Markdown cell is also in either edit or command mode. For example, double-click on the text you are reading: This puts you into edit mode. Now, you could change the formatting (e.g., make a word printed in *italics* or **bold** with single or double asterisks) and \"execute\" the cell to render the text as specified.\n",

    "Therefore, coding is learned best by just doing it for some time on a daily or at least a regular basis and not right before some task is due, just like learning a \"real\" language.\n",

    "### The Maker's Schedule\n",
    "\n",
    "[Y Combinator <img height=\"12\" style=\"display: inline-block\" src=\"static/link_to_hn.png\">](https://www.ycombinator.com/) co-founder [Paul Graham <img height=\"12\" style=\"display: inline-block\" src=\"static/link_to_wiki.png\">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_%28programmer%29) wrote a very popular and often cited [article](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) where he divides every person into belonging to one of two groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Managers**: People that need to organize things and command others (e.g., a \"boss\" or manager). Their schedule is usually organized by the hour or even 30-minute intervals.\n",
    "- **Makers**: People that create things (e.g., programmers, artists, or writers). Such people think in half days or full days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever wondered why so many tech people work during nights and sleep at \"weird\" times? The reason is that many programming-related tasks require a \"flow\" state in one's mind that is hard to achieve when one can get interrupted, even if it is only for one short question. Graham describes that only knowing that one has an appointment in three hours can cause a programmer to not get into a flow state.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, do not set aside a certain amount of time for learning something but rather plan in an *entire evening* or a *rainy Sunday* where you can work on a problem in an *open end* setting. And do not be surprised anymore to hear \"I looked at it over the weekend\" from a programmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "When being asked the above question, most programmers answer something that can be classified into one of two broader groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1) Toy Problem, Case Study, or Prototype**: Pick some problem, break it down into smaller sub-problems, and solve them with an end in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2) Books, Video Tutorials, and Courses**: Research the best book, blog, video, or tutorial for something and work it through from start to end.\n",
    "\n",
    "The truth is that you need to iterate between these two phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building a prototype always reveals issues no book or tutorial can think of before. Data is never as clean as it should be. An algorithm from a textbook must be adapted to a peculiar aspect of a case study. It is essential to learn to \"ship a product\" because only then will one have looked at all the aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The major downside of this approach is that one likely learns bad \"patterns\" overfitted to the case at hand, and one does not get the big picture or mental concepts behind a solution. This gap can be filled in by well-written books: For example, check the Python/programming books offered by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning/) or [O’Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/)."

    "As a good practice, it is recommended to click on \"Kernel\" > \"Restart Kernel and Run All Cells\" in the navigation bar once a notebook is finished. That restarts the Python process forgetting all **state** (i.e., all variables) and ensures that the notebook runs top to bottom without any errors the next time it is opened.\n",

    "#### Notebooks are linear\n",
    "\n",
    "While this book is built with Jupyter notebooks, it is crucial to understand that \"real\" programs are almost never \"linear\" (i.e., top to bottom) sequences of instructions but instead may take many different **flows of execution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, for a beginner's course, it is often easier to code linearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In real data science projects, one would probably employ a mixed approach and put reusable code into so-called Python modules (i.e., *.py* files; cf., Chapter 2) and then use Jupyter notebooks to build up a linear report or storyline for an analysis."

    "#### Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a problem, a computer scientist’s goal is to develop an algorithm, a step-by-step list of instructions for solving any instance of the problem that might arise. Algorithms are finite processes that if followed will solve the problem. Algorithms are solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We say that a problem is computable if an algorithm exists for solving it. An alternative\n",
    "definition for computer science, then, is to say that computer science is the study of problems that are and that are not computable, the study of the existence and the nonexistence of algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, you will note that the word “computer” did not come up at all. Solutions\n",
    "are considered independent from the machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer science, as it pertains to the problem-solving process itself, is also the study of abstraction. Abstraction allows us to view the problem and solution in such a way as to separate the so-called logical and physical perspectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the automobile that you may have driven to school or work today. As a driver, a user of the car, you have certain interactions that take place in order to utilize the car for its intended purpose. You get in, insert the key, start the car, shift, brake, accelerate, and steer in order to drive. From an abstraction point of view, we can say that you are seeing the logical perspective of the automobile. You are using the functions provided by the car designers for the purpose of transporting you from one location to another. These functions are sometimes also referred to as the interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the mechanic who must repair your automobile takes a very different point of view. She not only knows how to drive but must know all of the details necessary to carry out all the functions that we take for granted. She needs to understand how the engine works, how the transmission shifts gears, how temperature is controlled, and so on. This is known as the physical perspective, the details that take place “under the hood.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The same thing happens when we use computers. Most people use computers to write documents, send and receive email, surf the web, play music, store images, and play games without any knowledge of the details that take place to allow those types of applications to work. They view computers from a logical or user perspective. Computer scientists, programmers, technology support staff, and system administrators take a very different view of the computer. They must know the details of how operating systems work, how network protocols are configured, and how to code various scripts that control function. They must be able to control the low-level details that a user simply assumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The common point for both of these examples is that the user of the abstraction, sometimes also called the client, does not need to know the details as long as the user is aware of the way the interface works. This interface is the way we as users communicate with the underlying complexities of the implementation.\n",

    "#### Why Study Algorithms?\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer scientists learn by experience. We learn by seeing others solve problems and by solving problems by ourselves. Being exposed to different problem-solving techniques and seeing how different algorithms are designed helps us to take on the next challenging problem that we are given. By considering a number of different algorithms, we can begin to develop pattern recognition so that the next time a similar problem arises, we are better able to solve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithms are often quite different from one another. Consider the example of sqrt seen earlier. It is entirely possible that there are many different ways to implement the details to compute the square root function. One algorithm may use many fewer resources than another. One algorithm might take 10 times as long to return the result as the other. We would like to have some way to compare these two solutions. Even though they both work, one is perhaps “better” than the other. We might suggest that one is more efficient or that one simply works faster or uses less memory. As we study algorithms, we can learn analysis techniques that allow us to compare and contrast solutions based solely on their own characteristics, not the characteristics of the program or computer used to implement them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the worst case scenario, we may have a problem that is intractable, meaning that there is no algorithm that can solve the problem in a realistic amount of time. It is important to be able to distinguish between those problems that have solutions, those that do not, and those where solutions exist but require too much time or other resources to work reasonably.\n",
    "\n",
